# AUT Playground

Welcome to the AUT Playground repository! This project is a collaborative effort to create an interactive and engaging experience for AUT students.

## Branch Information

- **Branches with the prefix `Zoya`**:
  - These branches contain my personal work and experiments.
  - They showcase features I contributed to and are not guaranteed to represent the final, stable version of the project.
  - Explore these branches to gain insights into my individual contributions.

- **Release Branch**:
  - For the complete and stable version of the project, please refer to the `Release` branch.
  - The `Release` branch contains the finalized code and features prepared for deployment.

## Video Demonstration

A video demonstration of my major work on this project is available below. It highlights the following:

- The interaction between **three different user screens** playing the game "Bounty Hunter."
- How users are assigned different roles (Hider or Hunter) and receive specific tasks during the game.
- The dynamic points allocation system based on users' achievements in the game, which updates their profiles in real time.
- The use of **Socket.IO** for server-based real-time communication, enabling seamless interaction and synchronization between users.
- The use of **Expo** to streamline the development process, allowing for easy testing and deployment of the React Native app across multiple platforms.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: For building the mobile app interface.
- **Expo**: For simplifying app development and enabling rapid iteration and testing.
- **Socket.IO**: For real-time communication between the server and clients.
- **Firebase**: For authentication and database management.
- **Node.js**: For backend server development.

## How to Use the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shanayeen/AUT_Playground.git
   ```
2. Switch to the desired branch (`Release` for stable code or `Zoya_V2` for personal contributions):
   ```bash
   git checkout <branch-name>
   ```
3. Follow the setup instructions in the project to run the application locally.

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed as a collaborative effort with my teammates, showcasing teamwork and individual contributions to build a seamless gaming experience for AUT students.

## Scrum Methodologies

We followed Scrum methodologies throughout the development of this project to ensure an efficient and collaborative workflow. Key practices included:

- **Sprint Planning**:
  - Dividing the project into manageable sprints with clear objectives and deliverables.

- **Daily Standups**:
  - Brief team meetings to discuss progress, blockers, and next steps.

- **Sprint Reviews**:
  - Demonstrating completed work at the end of each sprint and gathering feedback from stakeholders.

- **Retrospectives**:
  - Reflecting on each sprint to identify areas of improvement and celebrate successes.

Using Scrum allowed us to adapt quickly to changing requirements and deliver a high-quality product through continuous collaboration and iteration.
